This repository contains our code for a university capstone project: Profit Forest - A Profit-Driven Random Forest for Telco Churn Prediction. We finished this project with R, and there are four `.R` files: 

  1. EDA & Data Preprocessing
  2. Benchmark_Random Forest
  3. Benchmark_Conditional Forest
  4. ProfTree & Profit Forest

The dataset we used can be found via this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset 

We shall give so much credits to Sebastiaan Höppner and his colleagues, as we refered to their paper a lot. (Höppner, S., Stripling, E., Baesens, B., vanden Broucke, S., and Verdonck, T. (2018). Profit driven decision trees for churn prediction. European Journal of Operational Research. DOI: 10.1016/j.ejor.2018.11.072\
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2018.11.072)

We refered to his github page as well, to learn the implementation of the ProfTree algorithm for constructing profit driven decision trees for customer churn prediction. https://github.com/SebastiaanHoppner/ProfTree

Welcome to any further discussions on this topic and our project :)
